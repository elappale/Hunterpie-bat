# Hunterpie-bat
This is a .bat file that launches Hunterpie and Monster Hunter Rise

Place hunterpie.bat in your hunterpie directory.
Then, run that instead of Hunterpie.exe to run both hunterpie and MHR in one click

You can make a shorcut to the .bat file, add it to taskbar or start menu, etc. etc.
